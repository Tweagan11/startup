UPDATE:HTML
  Fun stuff! Pretty straight forward when coding, VS Code Studio offers a lot of great features to code in, and just focus on structure when coding in HTML. Not a lot of variety when it comes to formatting aesthetic, but still can offer some things. Organize it with Body, main, sections, lists, navigation, footers and other simple formats to keep the page in line and understandable. Pretty straight forward though! Remember to commit!

UPDATE: AMAZON WEB SERVICES
  First get an IP address, then purchase a domain name through Route 53. Some cost more others cost less, but then go to hosted zones, create a root      domain linked to the IP address, and then also a wildcard with a * at the beginning.

Startup repository for my startup idea
(This idea has to do with Treehouse Talks, a company I currently help run which holds events where anyone from the community can speak on a variety of topics)

Imagine a website that connects all the greatest aspects of Treehouse Talks. The community, the presentations, and the events. Stay connected with the presenters themselves with our live presentation tab, either seeing the exact same presentation in front of you, or catching it live from home. Check out our merch with an easy yet secure checkout. Stay up to date with our events and recieve notifications everytime something is added or a change is made. Use our app with local companies to get deals and ideas for date night, dinners, and day trips! (Possible Future Feature) Treehouse Talks connects you with your peers, your community, and your future possibilities.

UPDATE: CSS and HTML
Figuring out spacing and different kind of development styles is a little tricky and takes some major trial and error. I constantly tried to make certain things fit
, like a video in a frame, but it wouldnt budge for some reason and I tried everything I could think of. Anyways, bootstrap has some really easy and customizable CSS that makes the pages look really clean and put together, which I really enjoy. Just remember to link them at the beginning!
